# 2Market - Final Grade - 70%
In this project, I supported 2Market, a fictional international supermarket, in using data analytics to better understand its customers and drive sales growth. Through detailed analysis of consumer and ad data, I uncovered key insights into purchase behaviour, product trends, and advertising effectiveness—translating raw data into actionable market

🧾 Project Summary
As part of my LSE coursework, I analysed customer and marketing data from 2Market, a global supermarket brand. The objective was to provide business insights on customer demographics, ad channel performance, and product sales. Deliverables included a technical report, interactive dashboard, and a business presentation tailored for marketing stakeholders.

❓ Business Problem
2Market wanted to refine its marketing strategy with data-backed answers to:

Who are our most valuable customers?
Which advertising channels convert best?
Which products perform best—and for whom?
⚙️ Analytical Approach Highlights
Cleaned and pre-processed data: Consolidated age, income, and marital status categories, handled outliers with justification, and ensured consistency across datasets.
SQL analysis: Joined datasets on customer ID. Queried demographic trends, product sales by segment, and advertising channel conversions to validate Tableau output.
Actionable dashboards: Built segmented Tableau dashboards by age, income, country, and channel. Emphasis was placed on clarity and business usability.
Strategic alignment: Tied insights back to 2Market’s goals—boosting sales, improving ad ROI, and guiding budget reallocation across channels.
